# pspnet

Work in progress...

Pyramid scene parsing convolutional neural network (pspnet) for semantic image 
segmentation written in Tensorflow (Keras api).

Pspnet, proposed by Zhao et al, is a block of layers after a feature extractor 
network that gathers global and regional context data from the image.

In this repo a resnet is used as the feature extractor.
